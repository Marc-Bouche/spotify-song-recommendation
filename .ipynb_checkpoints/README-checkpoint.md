### ðŸŒŸ **About "Gnod"**
"Gnod" is a dynamic recommendation platform specializing in music, art, literature, and products. It uses **collaborative filtering algorithms** to deliver tailored recommendations.  
Their flagship feature, the _music recommender_, lets users input three bands they like and suggests similar bands based on shared user preferences. You can try it out [here](https://www.gnoosic.com).  

Currently, "Gnod" is funded through **ad revenue**, but the company envisions partnerships with major music apps like _Deezer_, _Soundcloud_, _Apple Music_, and _Spotify_. To achieve this, they need to enhance and diversify their recommendations.
